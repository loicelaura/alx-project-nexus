# Fresh Groceries E-Commerce App

A modern, responsive e-commerce application built with React and powered by a JSON server. This app provides a seamless and interactive grocery shopping experience, showcasing key front-end development skills and a clean, user-friendly interface.

## Key Features

### Product Management
* **API Integration:** Fetches product data from a local JSON server (`db.json`) to dynamically render products.
* **Add New Product:** A user-friendly form allows new products to be added directly to the database.

### Filtering, Sorting, & Search
* **Product Filtering:** Users can filter products by category (e.g., fruits, vegetables, dairy).
* **Product Sorting:** Products can be sorted by price in ascending or descending order.
* **Search Functionality:** An integrated search bar allows users to find products by name quickly.

### User Experience
* **Infinite Scrolling:** Products are loaded in batches as the user scrolls, ensuring a smooth experience for large inventories.
* **Shopping Cart:** Users can add products to a shopping cart and view their total.
* **Checkout & Confirmation:** A modal provides a seamless checkout process, followed by a detailed confirmation page with an order summary.
